We address the question, whether taller athletes have better performance in basketball. Our results based on data from NBA 2014-2015 season, suggest that the relationship between height and efficiency ratings is significant and can be approximated by linear regression with quadratic polynomial. Additionally, the average height among across the positions is significantly different; moreover, central players are on average 13.35 cm taller than others, and the shooting guards are the ones to demonstrate significant increase in performance just because of height. This can be important for sport managers, as they can make sure their athletes are in the best positions to succeed and achieving higher efficiency ratings for their athletes thus aiming for higher NBA salaries.
